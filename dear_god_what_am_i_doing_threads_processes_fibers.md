# Dear God What Am I Doing? Concurrency and Parallel Processing

Here's a situation we've all be in at one point. We have a program. We
want to make that program faster. We know about threads, processes,
fibers. Then you start programming and you have no clue what to do. I
was there. It sucks. This talk guides you down the rabbit hole and
brings out the other side.

Points covered:

* Threads, Fibers
* Processes, Forking, Detaching
* Parellelism vs Concurrency
* The many many different ways I crashed my computer learning these
  things
* Gotchas of each
* Common ways you shoot yourself in the foot
* Celluoid

This is a learning and informative talk. It's target at intermediate
developers who have ruby experience but never written any multi threaded
code.
