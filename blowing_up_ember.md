# Blowing Up Ember(-Data)

## Abstract

Expected Time: 30 minutes

Once upon a time I saw Ember and Ember-Data. I thought to myself: this
is great! I'll just load all my data into the client and voilla, instant
performance. I was so wrong. Just so very wrong. Ember-Data has its
limits. Once you have the data, then ember itself has its own limits.
No one knows exactly how much these frameworks can handle. People
casually throw around "a lot" but that's not quantifiable. I put ember
and ember-data through its paces to find how exactly what its limits
are.
