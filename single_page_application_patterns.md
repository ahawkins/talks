# Single Page Application Patterns

Expected Time: 30 Minutes

Writing complex Javascript applications comes with a unique set
problems. We've run up into many different ones. Through our successes
and failures we've come up with a set of patterns. These are not
specific to our application but are when you're building a certain
class of application. You don't need if you're building Todos. I'll
present patterns used in Javascript and things you can do from the API
perspective to make developing easier and more testable. These cover
topics such as DOM manipulation, resource separation, data loading,
testing, caching, and bootstrapping.
